**SYNOPSIS**

<br>

**DESCRIPTION**

**John Doll** is a senior Computer Science major at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

**John** is from Wapakoneta, Ohio and graduated from Wapakoneta High School in 2019. He has had an interest in computers and the like since late middle school/early high school. Something about the complexity of the machines and how they work is what first gravitated **John** to the subject. The vastness of it all has kept him from escaping the event horizon of the tech industry.

**John** has taken many Computer Science courses on a variety of topics including machine learning, cloud computing, computer and network security, data structures, algorithms, etc. He is still trying to decide what he likes best as he has a general love for CS and could see himself doing many different things. 

Some of **John**'s best work includes his [personal website](https://johnmdoll.com/), a COVID dashboard he helped to create in December 2020, and a yet to be released mobile app called Daily Tennis.
